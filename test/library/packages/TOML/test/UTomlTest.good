Before Mutation:
[A]

[A.B]
job = "programmer"
name = "sam"
number = 7

[A.C]
job = "programmer"
name = "Ben"


After Mutation:
[A]

[A.B]
job = "programmer"
name = "sam"
number = 7

[A.B.C]
new-key-added = true

[A.C]
job = "programmer"
name = "Ben"


A.B.number = 7

KV pairs in table A.C
job = "programmer"
name = "Ben"



[B]
job = "programmer"
name = "sam"
number = 7

[B.C]
new-key-added = true

[C]
job = "programmer"
name = "Ben"


Should be the same as

[B]
job = "programmer"
name = "sam"
number = 7

[B.C]
new-key-added = true

[C]
job = "programmer"
name = "Ben"
