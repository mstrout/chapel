Advent of Code 2021
===================

These are my (Brad's) personal entries to Advent of Code 2021.  At
present, they are snapshots of what I coded up in my spare time
between Dec 8 and Jan 3, and often aren't indicative of best practices
in software engineering or in using Chapel.  In a few cases, I've
tweaked them to make them more suitable for our test system, for
example by reducing the amount of output generated by default.  As
time permits, I may go back and clean them up over time to make them
more representative of better coding style and use of Chapel.

Though none of the problems required parallel solutions, since Chapel
is a parallel language, when possible/easy I did try to utilize
parallelism.  As the problems became more challenging and the holidays
approached, I got less aggressive about this.  In general, I also
tried to use the Chapel features that I thought were the coolest or
most appropriate for the problems rather than sticking to a C-like
subset of Chapel.

Generally, speaking, the files are as follows for a given day:

* dayX.chpl      : my program for the first (grey) star
* dayXa.chpl     : my program for the second (gold) star
* dayX.test      : the input set used by the AoC site as a sample
* dayX.in        : my (personal?) input for that day
* dayX*.execopts : execution-line command-line options for our test system
* dayX*.good     : the expected output for our test system

On days where multiple test cases were given, I've often also added
additional input and .good files.
