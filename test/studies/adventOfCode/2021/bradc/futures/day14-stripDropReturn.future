feature request: Have pure, returning routines warn when result not used

In this example, I temporarily forgot that '.strip()' doesn't modify
the string directly, but returns a modified string and wasted some
time before realizing my error.  Thinking about what the compiler
could do to help with this, one idea would be to have routines that
are side-effect-free generate warnings when their return values aren't
used to avoid such confusion.
