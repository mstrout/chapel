feature request/error message: 'ref' arguments with defaults

It seems as though we should support 'ref' arguments that have new
default values, which can be useful in recursive settings like this
one.  Otherwise, either the callee must pass in a variable they may
not care about, or the routine must create a bootstrapping overload of
itself that doesn't take the additional arg.

I was originally thinking that maybe we should just permit '0' to be
passed in for such cases, but in #19116, Paul and Michael talked me
down from this, so I'm updating the issue to support the ability to
say 'new int()' instead.
