feature request: maxloc should work with string indices

While working on this, I really found myself wanting to do a maxloc
reduce over an associative array with string indices, but
unfortunately this wasn't possible because our current implementation
relies on the ability to do a 'max(type idxType)' operation on the
idxType, and strings don't support it.  (Note that this error message
also isn't particularly clear to someone who doesn't already know the
'maxloc' implementation details, though here I'm asking for the
capability rather than a better error message).
