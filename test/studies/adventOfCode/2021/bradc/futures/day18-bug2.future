error message: unclear error message points to internal OwnedObject.chpl module

The cause of this error message isn't particularly clear to a user and
it points to an internal module, which isn't particularly helpful.
I'm not sure what the good result should be (I suspect this code isn't
right), so put the output I was striving for into the .good file as a
placeholder.
