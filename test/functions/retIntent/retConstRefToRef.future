error message: 'ref' <- 'const ref' assignment not caught early enough

#18909

This test shows that we permit a function returning a `const ref` to
be saved in a `ref` variable, which seems to inherit its const-ness,
resulting in an error when we try to assign through it.  But the
actual error should be at the point that we attempt to save the
returned `const ref` into a plain-old `ref`, similar to how we
generate errors when assigning a `const ref` to a `ref` (which I
used as a basis for the proposed wording in the .good file, though
I'm not married to it).
