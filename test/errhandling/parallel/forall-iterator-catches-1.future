bug: iterator handler catches errors in loop body

Currently a try block within a parallel iterator handles both the exceptions
thrown within the iterator and those thrown in the loop body of the forall.
It should handle only the exceptions thrown within its lexical scope.

This happens when the try block surrounds a task construct.
Cf. when the try block surrounds a yield without a task construct in between,
the behavior is correct, see forall-iterator-catches-2.chpl
